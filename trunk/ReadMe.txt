This is a CodeBlocks project but can easily be compiled either manually on the command line or with a quickly written makefile.
It is pretty platform independent using standard file functions.
The Ubuntu built release version of MIDITOR is included in this directory.
Read MIDITOR,txt for an overview and example song.
The 12BarMacros.txt and 12BarNoMacros.txt in Examples directory shows the same song done with and without macros.
When editing and compiling songs I tend to use a command line midi player in a script to check it.
The script also compiles the song before hand.
