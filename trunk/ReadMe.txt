MIDITOR is a command line compiler that takes ASCII, chromatically scored, guitar/drum tab like, files, compiling them into accurate multi track (channel) MIDI files.
This is a CodeBlocks project but can easily be compiled either manually on the command line or with a quickly written makefile.
It is pretty platform independent using standard file functions.
The Linux Ubuntu built version of MIDITOR and the Windows 32 version (LINUX WINE compatible) miditorwin32.exe are included in this directory.
Read MIDITOR.txt for an overview and example song.
Easier examples are in the Examples directory.
The 12BarMacros.txt and 12BarNoMacros.txt in the Examples directory are the same song done with and without macros.
When editing and compiling songs I tend to use a command line midi player in a script to check it, after the script has also compiled the song before hand.
