MIDITOR is a command line compiler that takes ASCII edited music which can be in the style of drum or guitar tablature but with accuracy. Any MIDI message can be sent at specific times including patch changes, control changes.... Tracks and channels can be easily rendered in parallel and the powerful macro preprocessor handles the repetitious nature of music writing. Music is easily scored in any editor chromatically and then output as a MIDI file to quickly check and play the score on FluidSynth or Timidity for instance. Conventional style guitar and drum tab can be used, even conventional style notation using macros, or just one line of chromatic notation.
